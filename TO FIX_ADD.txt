TO FIX:
	-slow deletion and moving times??
	prevent usage on settings page/non calendar view page. I think we can do this by checking for existence of certain elements, since on SPA they will be unrendered if not in view like in settings

TO ADD:
	-Bulk Copy/Paste & Duplicate
	-UNDO BUTTON
	-BULK CREATE
